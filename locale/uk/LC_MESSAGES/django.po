"What makes SALT different from others? Well, we have a zero-fake-policy "
"here. Fakes make online shopping unbearable. The countterfeit industry in "
"fashion is valued around $600 billion. While someone makes tons of money, "
"the quality of shopping for the customer is deteriorating. But we love "
"shopping. Probably even more than you. So we set up a very simple goal -  to "
"make shopping as pleasant and safe as possible. Therefore, on SALT you can "
"be 100% sure that you are buying a nice authentic piece."

"SALT has two-factor product verification (sounds awesome, right?). In simple "
"words, each item is checked exactly two times. The first one happens right "
"after uploading. Just in a few seconds, our AI-model assigns a label to the "
"product - fake or authentic. The model thinks fast and improves itself with "
"each loaded item (neural networks and all that). And the second step is a "
"thorough manual check performed by our experienced experts. Thanks to the "
"two-factor verification of all items, no fake will get to SALT."

"Simplicity is our core concept. And it's not only limited in minimalistic "

"is a community where designer and streetwear clothes take their second "
"chance. The item finds its new owner without harming the environment. SALT "
